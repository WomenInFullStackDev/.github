## About 

### I created **WomenInSoftwareDev** — an open-source project dedicated primarily to software developers and hands-on programmers.

The phrase ‘Women in Tech’ often encompasses a wide range of digital and real-life tech roles, making it challenging to identify which fields are truly represented. 

While the website includes a submenu highlighting other fields, the primary focus is on celebrating and supporting women who are deeply involved in programming. 

**WomenInSoftwareDev** offers a space where women in software development can connect, share knowledge, inspire one another, and collaborate on open-source projects.

## Projects

The organization currently hosts:

- **[womeninsoftware.dev](https://github.com/WomenInSoftwareDev/womeninsoftware.dev):** The live website showcasing women in software development.
